> I just wanna be okay
> Fuck everything in the way
> I never know what to say
> I never know what to say
> Always a new price to pay
> Start it like it's a new day
> I know more colors than gray
> I know I'm flying away

> You know where Iâ€™m coming,
> From though I am running,
> To you, all I feel is deny, deny, denial,
> I wanted to be a better brother, better son,
> Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done,
> I have none to show to the one I love,
> But deny, deny, denial.

> every song that i write just coexists with a scar
> and i've got paragraphs about the shit that i will never say
> cause it'll kill you just to hear me whine and bitch all fucking day
> maybe the grass is green in other states where i choose to reside
> maybe a glimpse of light will formulate and catch my fucking eye
> and maybe you'll hear this when you check my page and ask if i'm alright
> cause i've been afraid of all the darkest places lying in my mind

> Have you ever had a thought that just eats away your brain?
> And if you decide to kill it, then you'll probably go insane?
> Writing letters to yourself in hopes that it'll stop the pain
> But you're livid and it's vivid when you've got nothing to gain
> Bipolarity, hilarity, I'm laughing at myself
> Honestly I probably shouldn't though cause I just need some help

> So won't you say goodnight
> So I can say goodbye
