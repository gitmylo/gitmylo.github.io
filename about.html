Making computers do things that i tell them to has been a passion of mine for a long time, i used to play with circuit boards and checked what everything did, i wanted to figure out everything. When i started in scratch i didn't know anything about programming and how it worked. I slowly figured it out but it was not until 2017 that i really picked up an actual programming language. C# was the first programming language i learned that actually used code. In the beginning i didn't really know much about the scope of the program. but i slowly learned the basics by just guessing and googling. When i knew the basics of C# i was interested in making Minecraft mods, i had already tried making them with a drag and drop minecraft mod maker, but i wanted to try the real thing. So for that first i followed tutorials 1:1 but slowly learned what everything did and in 2018 i understood basic java. In later years i have learned other new languages with ease, after i understood advanced java, i went back to c# which it wasn't hard to learn more in. I also learnt basic javascript in the years inbetween. When i realised how easy it was to learn more advanced c#, i tried out python, which i learned from a python guide. It didn't take much time anymore because of my previous experience. I then wanted to try out some web development things, and i learned html and a little css to make static webpages. A while after learning html and css i went to learn php and sql through an app for learning programming languages. I completed both those courses in the same day, and after that i understood basic php and sql. A few years later i went to a school for software development, only to realise that i was way ahead of the level we were currently learning at. There were definitely new subjects. But they took me a few hours to learn instead of the week(s) we got for them. Making that school extremely boring. I am still going to that same school as of right now. But it's boring me and i don't know what to do about it. I want to graduate but it feels like a really long wait...</p></div></div></body></html>
